# ColdFusion REST Comparison

This repo is a collection of sample REST API's implemented using various frameworks for ColdFusion.

* CF10's native REST functionality
* ColdBox: Relax
* Mach-II (1.9 bleeding edge release)
* Powernap
* Taffy

The same model is reused throughout all examples.

## Database

I'm using MySQL for the purposes of my presentation, but there's no reason it shouldn't be able to run on MSSQL/etc. To date I haven't prepared a script to generate the DB -- just haven't needed it.

## Presentation

I've created this repo as part of a presentation for [CFObjective 2012](http://www.cfobjective.com) on this topic. The slide deck is also included in the repo (in _slides), and makes use of the awesome [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation library.
